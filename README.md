# Simple Image Uploader App

This is a basic Android application built with Jetpack Compose that allows users to upload and display an image. It offers the flexibility to capture a new picture using the device camera or select an existing one from the gallery.

## Features:

* **Image Upload:** Choose between capturing a new photo with your camera or uploading one from your device's gallery.
* **Image Display:** View the selected image within the app. 
* **Persistence:** The app stores the selected image locally, so it persists across app sessions.

## How it Works:

1. **Image Selection:** The app provides two buttons for image selection: "Take Photo" and "Upload Photo". 
2. **Permissions:** Before accessing the camera or gallery, the app requests the necessary permissions.
3. **Image Storage:** Once an image is selected, it's copied to the app's private storage for persistence.
4. **Image Display:** The selected image is then displayed in the app's main view.
