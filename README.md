A simple but powerful Android app for quickly uploading and viewing images, built with modern Jetpack Compose.

## Features:

* **Image Upload:** Choose between capturing a new photo with your camera or uploading one from your device's gallery.
* **Image Display:** View the selected image within the app. 
* **Persistence:** The app stores the selected image locally, so it persists across app sessions.

## How it Works:

1. **Choose your source:** Tap "Take Photo" to use your camera or "Upload Photo" to browse your gallery.
2. **Grant Permissions:** The app will ask for necessary permissions to access your camera or storage.
3. **View Your Image:** The selected image will be displayed immediately, and it's saved for the next time you open the app!
